# Python Basic calculator
This project was built to perform basic calculator operations

# Calculator operations
The calcualtor is capable of addition, subtraction, division and multiplication

# How python is used to create calculator operations
Four functions are created for the 4 different calculator operations (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication).
They are then called later in the program and they return the result of each operation in a control flow section
To enable the user to make consecutive calculations without having to re-run the program the control flow section which codes for the calculation operations of the program is in a while loop.
The user is able to break out of the loop by typing the letter q when asked for an operator which will break the loop
